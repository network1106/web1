    <h1>HTML이란 무엇인가?</h1>
    Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)
    is the standard markup language for
    <strong>creating <u>web</u> pages</strong> and web applications.
    Web vrowsers receive HTML documents from a web server of from local storage and render them
    into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally
    included cues for the appearance of the document.

It provides a means to create strucutred documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are
        delineated by tags, written using angel brackets.</p>
